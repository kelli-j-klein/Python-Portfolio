# Medical Insurance Project with Python

# create the initial variables below
age = 28
sex = 0
bmi = 26.2
num_of_children = 3
smoker = 0

# Add insurance estimate formula below
insurance_cost = 250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500

print("This person's insurance cost is " + str(insurance_cost) + " dollars.")
# Output is This person's insurance cost is 5469.0 dollars.

# Age Factor
age += 4
print(age)
# Output is 32

new_insurance_cost = (250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500)

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost

print("The change in estimated insurance cost after increasing the age by 4 years is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars")
# Output is The change in estimated insurance cost after increasing the age by 4 years is 1000.0 dollars

# BMI Factor
age = 28
bmi += 3.1

new_insurance_cost = (250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500)

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost

print("The change in estimated insurance cost after increasing the BMI by 3.1 is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars")

# Output is The change in estimated insurance cost after increasing the BMI by 3.1 is 1147.0 dollars

# Male vs. Female Factor
bmi = 26.2

new_insurance_cost = (250 * age - 128 * sex + 370 * bmi + 425 * num_of_children + 24000 * smoker - 12500)

change_in_insurance_cost = new_insurance_cost - insurance_cost

print("The change in estimated insurance cost for being male instead of female is " + str(change_in_insurance_cost) + " dollars")
# Output is The change in estimated insurance cost for being male instead of female is -128.0 dollars
